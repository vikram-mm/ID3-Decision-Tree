# ID3-Decision-Tree
The ID3 algorithm for building a decision tree is implemented. data_preProcess.cpp gets the input in the csv file to the required format. This has to be given as the input to the id3_general.cpp. Clustering of input can be done if the attributes take continuous values to improve the accuracy.
